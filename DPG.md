# Digital Public Good Compliance

This document outlines how SimpleAudit meets the requirements of the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/).

---

## 1. SDG Relevance

SimpleAudit contributes to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:

### SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
**Target 3.8**: Achieve universal health coverage, including access to quality essential health-care services.

SimpleAudit includes a dedicated **healthcare scenario pack** that helps developers audit AI systems used in medical contexts. By enabling systematic testing for:
- Appropriate emergency response handling
- Safe boundaries around medical diagnoses
- Responsible prescription-related interactions
- Prevention of harmful medical advice

SimpleAudit helps ensure that AI-powered healthcare tools meet safety standards before deployment, protecting patients and supporting healthcare providers in delivering safe digital health services.

### SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
**Target 9.5**: Enhance scientific research and upgrade technological capabilities.

SimpleAudit advances responsible AI development by:
- Providing an accessible, low-cost framework for AI safety testing
- Enabling organizations of all sizes (including those in developing countries) to audit their AI systems
- Supporting multilingual auditing capabilities to ensure AI safety across language barriers
- Reducing barriers to AI safety testing through minimal dependencies and simple setup

### SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
**Target 16.6**: Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions.

SimpleAudit supports AI governance and accountability by:
- Enabling systematic documentation of AI system behavior through exportable audit reports
- Supporting regulatory compliance efforts for AI systems
- Providing transparency tools that help institutions demonstrate due diligence in AI deployment
- Facilitating red-team testing that aligns with emerging AI governance frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF)

## 2. Ownership

**Project Ownership**: SimpleAudit is owned and maintained by its contributors, operating as an open community project.

**Core Maintainers and Affiliated Organizations**:
- Michael A. Riegler — Simula Research Laboratory, Norway
- Sushant Gautam — Simula Research Laboratory, Norway
- Maja Gran Erke — The Norwegian Directorate of Health
- Hilde Lovett — The Norwegian Directorate of Health
- Sunniva Bjørklund — The Norwegian Directorate of Health
- Tor-Ståle Hansen — Ministry of Defense, Norway

**Intellectual Property**: All code is released under the MIT License. Copyright is held collectively by "SimpleAudit Contributors" as specified in the LICENSE file.

**Governance**: The project follows an open governance model where contributions are welcome from the community. Core maintainers review and approve changes. For governance questions, contact the maintainers via GitHub Issues.

## 3. Platform Independence

SimpleAudit is designed to be **platform-independent** and does not lock users into proprietary services:

| Component | Proprietary Option | Open Alternative |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Auditing LLM | Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT | Ollama (local), vLLM (local serving) |
| Target System | Any | OpenAI-compatible API (open standard) |
| Data Export | — | JSON (open format) |
| Visualization | — | Matplotlib (open source) |

**Key Independence Features**:
- **Local-first option**: Users can run audits entirely locally using Ollama or vLLM with no API keys or external dependencies
- **No vendor lock-in**: The provider abstraction layer allows switching between LLM providers with a single parameter change
- **Open API standard**: Targets any OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint, which is widely supported across open-source inference servers (vLLM, Ollama, LiteLLM)

---

## 4. Documentation

SimpleAudit provides comprehensive documentation:

| Resource | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| README | `/README.md` | Installation, quick start, full API reference |
| Examples | `/examples/` | Jupyter notebooks with working examples |
| Code Comments | `/simpleaudit/` | Inline documentation in source files |
| Tests | `/tests/` | Test files demonstrating expected behavior |

---

## 5. Data Extraction Mechanism

SimpleAudit supports data extraction in **non-proprietary formats**:

```python
# Export audit results to JSON
results.save("audit_results.json")

# Programmatic access to all result data
for result in results:
    print(result.scenario_name)
    print(result.severity)
    print(result.conversation)  # Full conversation history
```

**Supported Export Formats**:
- **JSON**: Full audit results including conversations, scores, and metadata
- **PNG**: Visualization charts (via matplotlib)

All data structures use standard Python types (dictionaries, lists, strings) that can be easily converted to CSV, XML, or other formats.

## 6. Privacy and Applicable Laws

### Data Collection Statement

**SimpleAudit does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** It is a developer tool that runs locally or connects to user-specified AI endpoints.

**What SimpleAudit processes**:
- Synthetic test prompts (generated during auditing)
- AI model responses (from user's own systems)
- Audit results (stored locally by the user)

**What SimpleAudit does NOT do**:
- Collect telemetry or usage data
- Phone home to external servers
- Store any data outside the user's local environment
- Process end-user PII (unless the user's target system does so)

### User Responsibility

Users deploying SimpleAudit to audit systems that handle PII are responsible for:
- Ensuring their testing practices comply with applicable laws (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Not including real PII in custom test scenarios
- Following their organization's data handling policies

---

## 7. Standards and Best Practices

SimpleAudit aligns with the following standards and frameworks:

### AI Safety & Governance
| Standard | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** | Supports "Map" and "Measure" functions through systematic AI behavior testing |
| **EU AI Act** | Enables testing for high-risk AI system compliance requirements |
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | Supports AI management system auditing requirements |
| **OECD AI Principles** | Advances transparency and accountability in AI systems |

### Software Development
| Standard | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **OpenAPI Specification** | Target API follows OpenAI chat completions standard |
| **Python PEP 8** | Code style enforced via Black and Ruff |
| **Semantic Versioning** | Version numbering follows semver conventions |
| **SPDX License Identifier** | MIT license clearly identified |

### Security Testing
| Framework | Alignment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **OWASP AI Security** | Scenario packs test for prompt injection, jailbreaking, and manipulation |
| **MITRE ATLAS** | Red-teaming approach aligned with adversarial ML threat framework |

## 8. Do No Harm

### Responsible Use Policy

SimpleAudit is designed to **improve AI safety**, not to enable harm. We expect users to:

1. **Use for defensive purposes**: Test your own systems or systems you have authorization to test
2. **Report vulnerabilities responsibly**: If you discover vulnerabilities in AI systems, follow responsible disclosure practices
3. **Avoid malicious use**: Do not use SimpleAudit to develop attacks against AI systems you don't own
4. **Consider downstream effects**: When creating custom scenarios, avoid content that could cause harm if misused

### Safeguards Built Into SimpleAudit

- **No weaponized prompts included**: Built-in scenarios test for safety boundaries without providing actual attack payloads
- **Judgment-based evaluation**: Results require human interpretation; the tool doesn't automate attacks
- **Transparent methodology**: All test scenarios are visible and auditable in the source code

### Content Moderation (For Audit Results)

SimpleAudit generates reports on AI system behavior. Users should:
- Review audit results for sensitive content before sharing
- Redact any unexpected PII that may appear in AI responses
- Follow their organization's data classification policies

### Community Standards

Contributors and users are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which prohibits:
- Harassment or discrimination
- Sharing content that promotes harm
- Using the project for malicious purposes
